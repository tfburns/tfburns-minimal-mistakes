How complex would you say the following sound is? [crank engine sound]

And this? [doorbell sound]

When we asked volunteers, most said the sound of the crank engine is more complex than the doorbell sound. But why?

We tested 158 sounds and asked volunteers to rate them for complexity and pleasantness. We also asked them to name the sound. We used what are called non-linguistic sounds. Linguists might argue that it’s possible to construct a language with arbitrary sounds, including the sounds we tested, but in the common soundscape of our participants these were sounds which didn’t have linguistic meaning. The value of these sounds to scientists and clinicians is that their physical processing at the level of the ear and early neural pathways is common to speech but lacking the same affective influences and linguistic demands. This potentially makes them a useful tool for complex hearing tests in nonverbal children and adults with language difficulties or differences. Developing hearing tests which are also relevant to the real-world soundscapes patients experience day-to-day is another big advantage.

After we collected the ratings of the database of 158 non-linguistic sounds, we analysed their audio waveforms. Waveforms are the raw digital signals which cause the speakers you’re listening to right now to vibrate the air, which in turn vibrates your eardrum, some tiny ear bones, the fluid in your inner ear, and eventually some highly-specialised hair cells which detect these vibrations and turn them into nerve signals for your brain to interpret.

We found that the ratings of the sounds were associated with multiple mathematical and statistical measures of those same waveforms. For example, something called the Higuchi fractal dimension estimate – a measurement originally developed for detecting earthquakes and is considered to detect notions of statistical complexity and self-similarity in signals – correlated with ratings of sounds’ complexity from humans. Sounds which were rated as highly pleasant, like a windchime [chime sound] also had highly harmonic waveforms.

So, next time you hear a sound [bear growl, coo-coo clock, water bubbling], know that your subjective perceptions of it are at least in part associated with some deep mathematical features.
