There are many potential vices of formalization and dangers in the use of machine learning systems in medicine and other ethically-sensitive domains. However, I see there are also virtues and opportunities which are critical for building trust in medical and healthcare systems, reducing errors and biases, and enabling the sharing and replication of successful models. I briefly describe this view in this commentary, published by the Journal of Medical Ethics.
