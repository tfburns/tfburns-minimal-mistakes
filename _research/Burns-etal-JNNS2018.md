The first 4-month rotation of my PhD was with Jun Tani, where I learnt a lot about RNNs and robotics. I 

In my research with RNNs, it was important to use naturalistic yet low-dimensional data. For this purpose, I built a simple GUI application in Python to generate and collect 2D mouse input data.

We introduce an adaptive time constant for the multiple timescales recurrent neural network (MTRNN) inspired by the work of philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941). Observed variations in the recent activity of MTRNN neurons is used to adapt the time constant. We analyse how the time constant adapts in response to neuronal activity for a simple one-dimensional function-fitting task.
