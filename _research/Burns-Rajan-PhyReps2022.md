When neurons send signals to each other in the brain, they become active at specific, brief periods of time. These signals are called “spikes”. Neurons can encode information using the timing of these spikes, but how spike timings change under conditions of brain injury and throughout functional recovery is largely unknown in the sensory areas of the brain. Together with colleagues, I analysed the temporal activity patterns of neurons in two layers of the brain area responsible for rodents’ whisker sensation, called barrel cortex (due to the area looking like barrels under the microscope, where each ‘barrel’ is responsible for processing the information from a single whisker).

The two layers we analysed were the main input layer (called layer 4) and one of the first processing layers (called layer 2). In all, we analysed the activity profiles of 1,210 neurons down to the precision of milliseconds. About half of those were healthy neurons, and the other half were from rats who experienced a diffuse traumatic brain injury – the stereotypical injury experienced by humans in sport and vehicle accidents (also called a “whiplash” injury from the fluid in the brain rushing forward and then backwards in quick succession).

We developed novel algorithms to analyse responsive units with temporally-distinct components of the activity. Our findings demonstrate how temporal coding features maladapt or functionally recover differently in sensory cortex after injury. Surprisingly, some spike timings do appear to functionally recover (at least in the number of components and the timing between these components) – but the rates of ‘recovery’ are different between the layers. We speculate that this layer-dependent functional recovery is perhaps due to differences in the input or local inhibitory neuronal makeup in these layers. This finding may help clinicians identify novel therapeutic targets for treating patients with brain injuries.
