Broadly speaking, there are two types of neurons in the brain: excitatory and inhibitory. Inhibitory neurons are amazingly diverse compared to excitatory neurons. Why? Using a computational model with realistically-sized groups of excitatory neurons (representing memories) associated together in a network of memories, my colleagues and I have highlighted a biologically-plausible and behaviourally-useful function of inhibitory neuron diversity in memory.

Two standouts are:
1. inhibitory diversity can quadruple the range of memory retrieval; and
2. balancing the strength of different inhibitory neurons' influence on excitatory neurons can dramatically change how the network of memories become activated - from consolidating activity in one region of the network (like a mouse might do when exploiting its knowledge of where the cheese is) to spreading the activity like tentacles throughout the network (like what might happen when a mouse is exploring to find the cheese).

Thank you to my co-authors, Tatsuya Haga and Tomoki Fukai at OIST, for their support and collaboration in this project.
